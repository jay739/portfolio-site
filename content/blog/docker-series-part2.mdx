## 🛡️ The Security Foundation

Welcome to **Part 2** of my Home Server Chronicles! In Part 1, we explored the overall architecture and philosophy behind my Docker-powered ecosystem. Now, let's dive into the **core services** that form the backbone of secure external access.

These three services work together to create a robust, secure gateway to my home lab:

- 🌐 **Nginx Proxy Manager** — Reverse proxy with SSL termination
- 🔐 **Authelia** — 2FA authentication gateway  
- 🔒 **WireGuard (wg-easy)** — VPN tunnel for remote access

## 🌐 Nginx Proxy Manager: The Traffic Director

### Why NPM Over Traefik?

I chose **Nginx Proxy Manager** over Traefik for several reasons:

- 🎯 **Web UI**: Clean, intuitive interface for managing proxy hosts
- 🔐 **Built-in SSL**: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation
- 📊 **Real-time logs**: Easy debugging with live access logs
- 🎨 **Theme integration**: Works seamlessly with theme.park for dark mode
- 🔧 **Flexibility**: Easy custom configurations and advanced routing

### Configuration

Here's how NPM is configured in my `core.yml`:

```yaml
nginx-proxy-manager:
  image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
  container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
  restart: unless-stopped
  ports:
    - "80:80"                  # ✅ PUBLIC - HTTP proxy hosts
    - "443:443"                # ✅ PUBLIC - HTTPS proxy hosts
    - "127.0.0.1:81:81"        # ✅ LOCALHOST - admin interface
    - "10.0.0.110:81:81"       # ✅ LOCAL NETWORK - admin interface
    - "100.89.188.84:81:81"    # ✅ TAILSCALE - admin interface
  environment:
    - DISABLE_IPV6=true
    - TP_THEME=dark
    - TP_URL=http://theme-park:80
  volumes:
    - ./nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data
    - ./nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
  networks:
    - proxy_net
```

### Key Features in Action

**🔗 Proxy Hosts**: Each service gets its own subdomain:
- `jellyfin.jay739.dev` → `jellyfin:8096`
- `tools.jay739.dev` → `it-tools:80`
- `notes.jay739.dev` → `paperless-ngx:8000`

**🔐 SSL Certificates**: Automatically managed via Let's Encrypt:
- Wildcard certificates for `*.jay739.dev`
- Auto-renewal every 60 days
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect enforced

**🎨 Dark Theme**: Integration with theme.park for consistent dark mode across all services.

## 🔐 Authelia: The Authentication Guardian

### Two-Factor Authentication Everywhere

**Authelia** acts as a forward-auth middleware, protecting sensitive services with TOTP-based 2FA. It integrates seamlessly with Nginx Proxy Manager to add an authentication layer.

### Architecture

```
User Request → NPM → Authelia (if protected) → Target Service
```

### Configuration

In `infra.yml`, Authelia is configured with:

```yaml
authelia:
  image: authelia/authelia:latest
  container_name: authelia
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - ./authelia/config:/config
    - ./authelia/secrets:/secrets
  environment:
    - TZ=America/New_York  
  depends_on:
    - redis
  networks:
    - proxy_net
  ports:
    - "10.0.0.110:9091:9091"     # ✅ LOCAL NETWORK ACCESS
    - "100.89.188.84:9091:9091"  # ✅ TAILSCALE ACCESS
```

### What Gets Protected?

I use a tiered approach to security:

**🔒 High Security (2FA Required)**:
- Portainer (container management)
- Nginx Proxy Manager admin
- Vaultwarden (password manager)
- VS Code Server

**🔓 Medium Security (Local Network Only)**:
- Jellyfin (media streaming)
- Paperless-ngx (documents)
- Homarr (dashboard)

**🌐 Public Access**:
- Portfolio website
- IT-Tools (utility tools)
- Read-only services

### Setup Process

1. **Initial Configuration**: Users and groups defined in `users_database.yml`
2. **TOTP Setup**: Each user scans QR code with Google Authenticator
3. **Policy Rules**: Access control based on domains and user groups
4. **Session Management**: Remember devices for 30 days

## 🔒 WireGuard VPN: The Secure Tunnel

### Why WireGuard?

WireGuard provides the **secure tunnel** for remote access to my home lab. I use **wg-easy** for simplified management:

- 🚀 **Performance**: Modern, lightweight VPN protocol
- 🔧 **Easy Management**: Web UI for client configuration
- 📱 **Mobile Support**: Works great on iOS/Android
- 🔐 **Security**: State-of-the-art cryptography

### Configuration

```yaml
wg-easy:
  image: weejewel/wg-easy
  container_name: wg-easy
  restart: unless-stopped
  network_mode: host
  environment:
    - WG_HOST=${WG_HOST}
    - PASSWORD=${WG_PASSWORD}
    - WG_PORT=51820
    - WG_ALLOWED_IPS=0.0.0.0/0
    - WG_DEFAULT_DNS=172.25.0.7  # Points to Pi-hole
  volumes:
    - ./wg-easy:/etc/wireguard
  cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
    - SYS_MODULE
```

### Network Layout

My VPN setup creates a secure overlay network:

```
Internet → WireGuard (51820) → Home Network (10.0.0.0/24)
                                      ↓
                                Docker Networks
                                      ↓
                                 Services
```

### Client Configuration

Each device gets its own WireGuard configuration:

- **Work Laptop**: Full tunnel for secure remote work
- **Phone**: Split tunnel for accessing home services
- **Tablet**: Media streaming and document access

## 🚦 Traffic Flow: How It All Works Together

Here's the complete request flow for a protected service:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Nginx Proxy Manager]
    B --> C{Protected Service?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Authelia Authentication]
    C -->|No| E[Direct to Service]
    D --> F{Valid Session?}
    F -->|No| G[Login + 2FA]
    F -->|Yes| E
    G --> H[TOTP Verification]
    H --> E[Forward to Service]
    E --> I[Service Response]
    I --> J[User]
```

### Example: Accessing Portainer

1. **Request**: User navigates to `portainer.jay739.dev`
2. **NPM**: Nginx Proxy Manager receives request
3. **Auth Check**: Forwards to Authelia for authentication
4. **2FA**: User enters username/password + TOTP code
5. **Session**: Authelia creates session cookie
6. **Forwarding**: Request forwarded to Portainer container
7. **Response**: Portainer interface loads

## 🎯 Access Patterns

I've designed three distinct access patterns:

### 🏠 Local Network (10.0.0.110)
- **Usage**: When I'm at home
- **Security**: Reduced authentication for convenience
- **Services**: All services accessible directly

### 🌐 Internet (jay739.dev subdomains)
- **Usage**: Public internet access
- **Security**: Full 2FA protection for sensitive services
- **Services**: Curated list of safe-to-expose services

### 🔐 VPN Tunnel (100.89.188.84)
- **Usage**: Remote work and administration
- **Security**: VPN + 2FA for maximum security
- **Services**: Full access to all services

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Defense in Depth
- **Layer 1**: Firewall (ufw) blocks unnecessary ports
- **Layer 2**: VPN tunnel for remote access
- **Layer 3**: Reverse proxy with rate limiting
- **Layer 4**: 2FA authentication for sensitive services
- **Layer 5**: Container isolation and least privilege

### Fail2ban Integration
```bash
# Monitors NPM logs for failed auth attempts
[nginx-proxy-manager]
enabled = true
port = http,https
filter = nginx-proxy-manager
logpath = /var/log/nginx-proxy-manager/*.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 86400
```

### Regular Security Tasks
- Monthly SSL certificate renewal checks
- Quarterly user access reviews
- Regular backup of configuration files
- Monitor auth logs for suspicious activity

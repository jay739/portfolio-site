# Testing the New Build System

This is a test blog post to verify that our new build system with swap management works correctly.

## Why This Matters

Building Next.js apps on memory-constrained VPS servers can be challenging. Our new approach:

- ✅ Temporarily increases swap before building
- ✅ Automatically cleans up after build completes
- ✅ Prevents VPS crashes during compilation
- ✅ Makes the build process safe and repeatable

## What's Next?

After verifying this local build works, we'll set up GitHub Actions for fully automated deployments.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## 🏡 Welcome to My Home Lab

This is **Part 1** of an ongoing series where I document my self-hosted infrastructure journey—setting up, securing, and scaling an efficient and modular **Docker ecosystem** on my home server. I’ll take you through the choices I made, services I run, and challenges I solved.

For context: I'm running this system on a 🖥️ **Beelink SER8 mini PC**, equipped with:

- AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS  
- 32GB DDR5 RAM  
- 1TB NVMe SSD  
- Ubuntu Server OS

This machine replaced my Mac mini for Docker workloads and now acts as the heart of my **home cloud**, **developer platform**, and **AI lab**.

Additionally, I maintain a **backup VPS** on Digital Ocean that serves as an off-site backup location and disaster recovery solution, ensuring my data and services remain protected even if my home server becomes unavailable.

## 📦 Why Docker?

I chose Docker for the following reasons:

- 🧱 **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container
- 🔁 **Reproducibility**: No more “it works on my machine” issues
- 🚀 **Portability**: Move the stack between devices
- 📄 **Declarative Configuration**: All setup lives in `docker-compose` files

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

My goal was to keep things **modular**, **composable**, and **resilient**. Here’s what that looked like:

- 🔹 Split Compose files into roles: `core.yml`, `media.yml`, `infra.yml`, `extras.yml`
- 🔹 Avoid monolithic configurations
- 🔹 Use **external networks** defined in a central `networks.yml`
- 🔹 Enable **restart policies** and **volume mapping** for persistence
- 🔹 Log and monitor every service via Netdata

Each service is deployed **headlessly**, accessed either via browser, REST APIs, or reverse proxy.

| 1️⃣ | Intro & Architecture (you are here) |
| 2️⃣ | Core Services: Nginx, Authelia, Tailscale |
| 3️⃣ | Infra Layer: Portainer, VS Code, Cron, Backups |

Let’s begin with the **big picture**—how it’s all wired together.

## 🧱 Architecture

Here's a bird’s eye view of my setup:

```
                                      +-----------------------+
                                      |  Beelink SER8 (Host)  |
                                      +-----------------------+
                                                |
                       +------------------------+-------------------------+
                       |                        |                         |
                 Docker Compose          External Access             VPN Tunnel
              (core.yml + others)        (NPM, Authelia)              (Tailscale)
                       |
        +--------------+---------------------+
        |              |                     |
    Core Stack      Media Stack          AI Stack
  (Nginx, Auth)  (Jellyfin, Sonarr)   (Ollama, TTS, Bots)
```

Every service belongs to a category and communicates through pre-defined **Docker networks**, with `networks.yml` acting as the shared config.

**🔄 Backup & Disaster Recovery**:
My setup includes a **Digital Ocean VPS** that serves as an off-site backup location, ensuring data redundancy and providing a quick recovery option in case of hardware failure or other disasters.

## 🔄 Modularity with Compose

### ➕ File Structure

```bash
docker/
├── core.yml
├── infra.yml
├── media.yml
├── extras.yml
├── networks.yml
└── .env
```

### 🧩 Why Split Files?

This modular split helps in:

- ✅ Running specific layers independently  
- ✅ Upgrading only what you need  
- ✅ Easier debugging and configuration  
- ✅ Clear separation of concern

I also prefix volumes and container names per file to avoid naming conflicts.

---

## 🌐 Networks & Naming

Defined in `networks.yml`:

```yaml
networks:
  traefik:
    name: traefik
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    name: backend
    driver: bridge
  ai:
    name: ai
    driver: bridge
```

Services declare these external networks in their own files. This ensures containers are **interoperable across layers** without duplicating definitions.

---

## 🔐 Secrets and Security

Security is critical. Even a home server should have strong hygiene:

- 🔑 `.env` files store secrets (never committed)
- 🔒 Authelia + Nginx Proxy Manager enable 2FA and domain routing
- 🌍 Tailscale manages zero-config VPN with ACLs

All admin UIs are hidden behind TOTP authentication or VPN entry.

---

## 🧭 Reverse Proxy Flow

The reverse proxy stack routes requests like this:

```text
User → https://service.jay739.dev
       ↳ Nginx Proxy Manager
           ↳ Authelia (2FA if protected)
               ↳ Internal Docker container
```

Each app is accessible via a subdomain thanks to NPM + wildcard DNS setup via Cloudflare.

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

Every container’s health is tracked using **Netdata**, running on a dedicated `infra` container and exposed via:

🔗 [https://metrics.jay739.dev](https://metrics.jay739.dev)

Future parts will explore how I created a **custom Astro dashboard** to visualize key stats live on my portfolio.

---

## 🧰 Core Tools Installed on Host

Even though most things run in Docker, I have some native tools:

- 🛜 `tailscale` — for remote access  
- 🐳 `docker`, `docker-compose` — core engine  
- 📦 `fail2ban` — SSH brute force protection  
- 📃 `rsync`, `cron` — automated local backups  
- 🧠 `nvitop` — monitor GPU usage in terminal  

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

In the next part of this series, I’ll walk you through the **Core Services** stack in detail: reverse proxy, domain mapping, VPN access, and 2FA gateways.

Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out if you want to replicate this setup or have questions on customizing your own server stack! 💬

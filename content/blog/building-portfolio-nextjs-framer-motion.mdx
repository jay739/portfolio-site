# Building a Portfolio with Next.js and Framer Motion

Creating a modern portfolio website that stands out requires more than just good designâ€”it needs smooth animations, responsive layouts, and excellent performance. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build a stunning portfolio using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Framer Motion.

## Why Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 brings significant improvements to the React framework, including the new App Router, improved performance, and better developer experience. The App Router provides a more intuitive way to structure your application with file-based routing and nested layouts.

### Key Features

- **App Router**: File-based routing with nested layouts
- **Server Components**: Better performance and SEO
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript configuration
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization with `next/image`
- **Font Optimization**: Built-in font optimization

## Setting Up the Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

This command creates a new Next.js project with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality

## Installing Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that makes it easy to create smooth, professional animations:

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

## Creating Smooth Animations

One of the key benefits of Framer Motion is its declarative API. You can easily add animations to your components:

```tsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const AnimatedComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  >
    Your content here
  </motion.div>
);
```

### Animation Variants

You can define reusable animation variants:

```tsx
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1
    }
  }
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
};
```

## Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create responsive designs without leaving your HTML. The utility-first approach allows for rapid prototyping and consistent styling:

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {/* Your grid items */}
</div>
```

### Custom Animations

You can create custom animations using Tailwind's animation utilities:

```css
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.fade-in-up {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.5s ease-out;
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Next.js 14 provides several built-in optimizations:

### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, loading only what's needed:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>
});
```

### Image Optimization

Use the `next/image` component for automatic image optimization:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/profile.jpg"
  alt="Profile"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  priority
/>
```

### Font Optimization

Next.js optimizes fonts automatically:

```tsx
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

## SEO and Meta Tags

Next.js makes SEO easy with built-in metadata support:

```tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Portfolio',
  description: 'A showcase of my work and skills',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Portfolio',
    description: 'A showcase of my work and skills',
  },
};
```

## Deployment

Deploying your portfolio is straightforward with Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically on every push

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio with Next.js 14 and Framer Motion provides a solid foundation for creating modern, performant websites. The combination of TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations creates a powerful development stack.

Remember to focus on user experience, performance, and accessibility when building your portfolio. A well-crafted portfolio can be a powerful tool for showcasing your skills and attracting opportunities.

### Key Takeaways

- Use Next.js 14 for modern React development
- Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Optimize for performance and SEO
- Focus on responsive design
- Deploy with confidence using Vercel

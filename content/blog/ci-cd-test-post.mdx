# 🚀 Testing CI/CD Pipeline - Automated Deployment

This is a **test blog post** created to verify that our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is working correctly for automated portfolio deployments.

## 🎯 What We're Testing

When this post is committed and pushed to the main branch, the following should happen automatically:

1. **Jenkins Pipeline Triggers** - Detects the new commit
2. **Dependencies Installation** - Installs npm packages
3. **Docker Image Build** - Builds the Next.js application
4. **Container Testing** - Verifies the new content is accessible
5. **Production Deployment** - Updates the live site at `jay739.dev`

## 🔧 Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Code Checkout
- Pulls latest code from Git repository
- Validates the new MDX file is present

### Stage 2: Install Dependencies
- Runs `npm ci` (or `npm install` as fallback)
- Ensures all packages are up to date

### Stage 3: Build Docker Image
- Builds using existing `core.yml` configuration
- Creates optimized production image

### Stage 4: Test Container
- Starts container with new image
- Verifies the test post is accessible
- Checks for any build errors

### Stage 5: Deploy to Production
- Stops current portfolio container
- Deploys new container with updated content
- Cleans up old images

## ✅ Success Criteria

If this post appears on your live portfolio site at `jay739.dev/blog/ci-cd-test-post`, then the CI/CD pipeline is working perfectly!

## 🎉 Expected Result

After pushing this post:
- **Jenkins Dashboard**: Should show a successful build
- **Live Site**: This post should be visible at `/blog/ci-cd-test-post`
- **Deployment Time**: Should take 2-3 minutes from push to live

## 🔍 Monitoring

You can monitor the deployment process by:
1. Checking Jenkins dashboard at `http://100.89.188.84:8090`
2. Watching the build logs in real-time
3. Verifying the post appears on your live site
